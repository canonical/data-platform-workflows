Run integration tests on parallel GitHub runners

By default, [pytest-operator](https://github.com/charmed-kubernetes/pytest-operator) runs each test file (Python module) in a separate Juju model. Usually, on GitHub, each integration test file is run in parallel (on separate runners).

This plugin allows further parallelizationâ€”an individual test file can be split into multiple groups. Each group can run on a separate GitHub runner.

## Usage

### Installation
Add
```
git+https://github.com/canonical/data-platform-workflows@v2#subdirectory=python/pytest_plugins/pytest_operator_groups
```
to your integration test Python dependencies.

If your dependencies are managed with tox, replace `#` with `\#` (to escape comment syntax).

### Split test functions into groups
Add
```python
@pytest.mark.group(1)
```
to every test function. Replace `1` with the group number.

#### Deciding how to split tests into groups

Take a look at this Discourse post: https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/faster-ci-results-by-running-integration-tests-in-parallel/8816

### Run tests
```
pytest test_file.py --group=1
```

### In CI, discover groups and provision a runner for each group
```
pytest --collect-groups
```
saves a JSON-encoded string to `GITHUB_OUTPUT`. Example:
```json
[
  {
    "path_to_test_file": "tests/integration/relations/test_database.py",
    "group_number": 1,
    "job_name": "relations/test_database.py | group 1"
  }
]
```

Use this output to create a GitHub Actions matrix. Example:
```yaml
jobs:
  collect-integration-tests:
    name: Collect integration test groups
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
      - name: Collect test groups
        id: collect-groups
        run: tox run -e integration -- --collect-groups
    outputs:
      groups: ${{ steps.collect-groups.outputs.groups }}

  integration-test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        groups: ${{ fromJSON(needs.collect-integration-tests.outputs.groups) }}
    name: ${{ matrix.groups.job_name }}
    needs:
      - collect-integration-tests
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: tox run -e integration -- "${{ matrix.groups.path_to_test_file }}" --group ${{ matrix.groups.group_number }}
```
