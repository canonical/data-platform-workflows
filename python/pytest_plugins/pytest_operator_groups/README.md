Run integration tests on parallel GitHub runners

Usage: [integration_test_charm.md](../../../.github/workflows/integration_test_charm.md)

By default, [pytest-operator](https://github.com/charmed-kubernetes/pytest-operator) runs each test file (Python module) in a separate Juju model. Usually, on GitHub, each integration test file is run in parallel (on separate runners).

This plugin allows further parallelizationâ€”an individual test file can be split into multiple groups. Each group can run on a separate GitHub runner.
